Basic Python Combat Simulation Game


First ever Python code. 

The Basic Game:

A basic game where players use their $10 to choose either an Archer, Soldier, or Knight (each costs $1) to assemble an army to play against their opponent. 
Archer beats Soldier, Soldier beats Knight, and Knight beats Archer. Anything else is a tie.


The Extended Game:

The extended game adds:
- Two new army options: Wizards, which beat everything other than Archers; and Siege Equipment, which beats everything other than Knights and Wizards.
- In the event that you lose a round and you still have money remaining for Medics (from your initial $10, your losing unit will be revived and returned to the back of your army.
